# UX Change Log

## 2025-11-26T04:46:00Z – Codex
- Homepage hero rebuilt to match Rip1/Rip2 inspiration: centered glass desk with fanned `meg_web` card backs, hover tilt/lift, neon glow, and responsive rail on mobile. CTA buttons now glow/bloom with glass outlines for secondary actions.
- Added reusable styles in `frontend/app/globals.css`: `cta-primary`/`cta-ghost` (with `data-tone` accents), `glass-surface`, `glass-chip`, and `hero-card` hover variables (`--rz`, `--tx-base`, `--ty-base`, `--rx`, `--ry`, `--tx`, `--ty`, `--lift`, `data-glow`).
- Homepage includes an embedded style guide section listing hover/glow classes and props for cards and CTAs.
- Placeholder art stays pointed at `public/card_back.png` (meg_web backs) until final art is ready; text callout added in hero to note this.

- Trimmed hero copy badges and bottom pills (“Collect/Rip/Redeem/Repeat”) for a cleaner hero; removed placeholder caption under the card fan to keep focus on the deck.
