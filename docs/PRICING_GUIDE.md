# PRICING_GUIDE (Deprecated)

Canonical pricing/oracle docs are:
- `../PRICE_ORACLE_RUNBOOK.md`
- `TEMPLATE_STANDARD.md` (mainnet template identity: set/language/collector number/rarity/finish)
- `HANDOFF_PRICE_ORACLE.md` (temporary status; archive after mainnet cutover)

This file is kept only as a legacy pointer and should be archived after mainnet cutover.
